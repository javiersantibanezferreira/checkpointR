\title{Check for Equal Checkpoints in a Given Stage}
\usage{
check_equal(stage)
}
\arguments{
\item{stage}{A character string specifying the stage folder to check within the "4_checkpoint" directory.}
}
\value{
A data frame listing groups of identical checkpoints with columns:
\describe{
  \item{ID}{Group identifier (letters).}
  \item{name}{Name of the checkpoint object.}
  \item{version}{Version number of the checkpoint.}
  \item{file}{File path of the checkpoint.}

If no equal checkpoints are found or fewer than two checkpoints exist in the stage, returns NULL with a message.
}
\description{
This function compares saved checkpoints within a specified stage and identifies groups of identical objects
(ignoring their attributes). It returns a data frame grouping checkpoints that are exactly the same.
}
\details{
The function reads the checkpoint log file "register.xlsx" inside the "4_checkpoint" folder, filters by the specified stage,
and loads all existing checkpoint files for comparison. It ignores object attributes when comparing.
